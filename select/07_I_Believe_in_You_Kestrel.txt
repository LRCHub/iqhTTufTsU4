Yes, I can tell by the look on your face
And I know that you mean it
When you say that you kept me a place
Beside you, cause I think I know
You need some company
But it takes so long to get it
And those things I've got to find
Are just disillusion that's taken my mind for show
If you're looking better, say come on too
You're gonna have to leave it
Cause I believe in you

Take your time on the things that you do
And try to dream of a fortune
Then you'll see just how good it can be
Forget me cause I think I've seen
A place to hide your face
But it takes so long to get there
And the memories that you see
Could only be there when I'm lifting you up to me
I know how to make it, I really do
You're gonna have to leave it
Cause I believe in you

Tell me, can you see me
I know I can
Tell me, can you see me
What a lonely man
Tell me, can you see me
I know I can
You think you know it all
But I'm not so sure at all
It's a longer way to fall
And you think it's very small
You got everything for me
And my confidence is free
Why believe, yes, why believe in you
