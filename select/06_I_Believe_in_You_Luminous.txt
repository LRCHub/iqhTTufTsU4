follow your heart
your dreams are in reach
look deep inside
love can set you free

whatever it takes
whatever await
this feeling will not fade

i believe in you

whatever you need
whatever you say
i will give you faith

i believe in you

don't lose your way
it's easy to fall
your fate is waiting
and your destiny calls

whatever it takes
whatever await
this feeling will not fade

i believe in you

whatever you need
whatever you say
i will give you faith
i believe in you
