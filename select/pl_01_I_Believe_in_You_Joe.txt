I never believed in dreaming
It never got me very far
I never believed
that love could find me
like an arrow
through the heart
I never believed in miracles
Or building castles in the air
Not until that day I found you
Turned around and you were there
From the day you came
you gave me
A whole new point of view
I've been touched by an angel
It's impossible but true
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love
will last always
I never believed in fairy tales
Though sometimes I wish I could
I never believed
that golden slippers
Could ever find the perfect foot
I never believed in magic
Or that wishes could come true
But your very first kiss
changed all this
something only you could do yeah
You made me a believer
you made me trust again
You showed me
there's a pot of gold
At every rainbow's end
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
no one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love
will last always
Only love sets you free
And if it's up to fate
then you're my destiny yeah
Now I know
Now I see
Anything can happen
if you just believe
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
no one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love
will last always
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
no one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love
will last always
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
no one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love
will last always
